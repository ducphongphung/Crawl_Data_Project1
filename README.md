## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Setup

If you want to run Adolla you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.  It's also possible not to use Git and to skip the next step by downloading the ZIP directly from GitHub. You can press the green "code" button on the top, then click "download ZIP".
To set this up, clone the repo. You can do this by running `git clone https://github.com/ducphongphung/Crawl_Data_Project1.git` in a terminal in the parent folder.

Then, navigate to the project folder using `cd` or other means and install the relevant packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start the app, run `py manage.py runserver`.This will host the web server. You can now navigate to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) on the machine to open the app in your browser.
